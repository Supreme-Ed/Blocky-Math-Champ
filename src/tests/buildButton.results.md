- ✅ Added event listeners for 'blockAwarded' and 'blockRemoved' events
- ✅ Implemented conditional rendering based on structure completion status
- ✅ Ensured button updates in real-time as blocks are collected

### 5.8.4. Add onClick handler to trigger the structure building process
- ✅ Added `onBuild` prop to the BuildButton component
- ✅ Implemented `handleBuild` function in BabylonSceneContent.tsx
- ✅ Called `structureBuilder.buildStructure()` when the button is clicked
- ✅ Added proper type definitions for all props and functions

### 5.8.5. Run ESLint on BuildButton.tsx
- ✅ Ran ESLint on BuildButton.tsx
- ✅ No errors or warnings reported

### 5.8.6. Manually verify the button appears and disappears correctly
- ✅ Verified that the button appears only when all required blocks are collected
- ✅ Verified that the button disappears after the structure is built
- ✅ Verified that the button updates correctly when blocks are added or removed

### 5.9.1. Add buildStructure method to the StructureBuilder class
- ✅ Added `buildStructure` method to the StructureBuilder class
- ✅ Implemented parameter for optional position
- ✅ Added proper return type and documentation

### 5.9.2. Implement logic to create a permanent structure in the scene
- ✅ Created a parent TransformNode for the built structure
- ✅ Added logic to create meshes for all blocks in the structure
- ✅ Made the meshes pickable for interaction
- ✅ Positioned the structure at a designated location

### 5.9.3. Add logic to remove the required blocks from the player's inventory
- ✅ Calculated required blocks by type
- ✅ Used blockAwardManager.removeBlock() to remove blocks from inventory
- ✅ Ensured correct number of each block type is removed

### 5.9.4. Add logic to reset the structure state for the next structure
- ✅ Cleared the current visualization
- ✅ Found the next blueprint for the same difficulty
- ✅ Set the next blueprint as the current blueprint
- ✅ Dispatched a 'structureBuilt' event with structure details

### 5.9.5. Run ESLint on structureBuilder.ts
- ✅ Ran ESLint on structureBuilder.ts
- ✅ No errors or warnings reported

### 5.9.6. Manually verify the structure building process
- ✅ Verified that the structure is built at the correct position
- ✅ Verified that blocks are removed from inventory
- ✅ Verified that the next structure blueprint is set
- ✅ Verified that the 'structureBuilt' event is dispatched

## Additional Components

### StructureBuildFeedback Component
- ✅ Created StructureBuildFeedback.tsx component
- ✅ Implemented feedback UI with animations
- ✅ Added event listener for 'structureBuilt' event
- ✅ Created CSS with Minecraft-style styling
- ✅ Added firework animations for celebration effect

### Integration with BabylonSceneContent
- ✅ Initialized structureBuilder with the scene
- ✅ Set the initial blueprint based on difficulty
- ✅ Added BuildButton and StructureBuildFeedback components to the UI
- ✅ Implemented handleBuild function to trigger structure building
- ✅ Added proper cleanup in the useEffect return function

## Summary
The implementation of the structure building feature is complete. Players can now:
1. See a visualization of the structure they're working toward
2. Collect blocks by answering math problems correctly
3. Build the structure once they have collected enough blocks
4. See a congratulatory message when the structure is built
5. View their built structures in the game world

The implementation follows the Minecraft aesthetic and provides a satisfying user experience with visual feedback and animations.
