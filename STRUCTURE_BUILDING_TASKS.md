# Structure Building Implementation Tasks

This document outlines the tasks required to implement the structure building functionality in the Minecraft-Style 3D Math Game.

## Overview

The structure building feature allows players to:
1. Collect blocks by answering math problems correctly
2. See a visualization of the structure they're working toward
3. Build the structure once they have collected enough blocks
4. View their built structures in the game world

## Completed Tasks

## Implementation Details

### BuildButton Component ✅
The BuildButton component:
- Is positioned prominently in the UI above the inventory
- Shows the name of the structure that can be built
- Has a clear call-to-action ("Build Now!")
- Is styled to match the Minecraft aesthetic with green color and 3D button effect
- Appears only when all required blocks are collected
- Is responsive and works on all screen sizes

### buildStructure Method ✅
The buildStructure method:
- Creates a permanent structure in the scene
- Removes the required blocks from the player's inventory
- Triggers appropriate visual feedback through the StructureBuildFeedback component
- Resets the structure state for the next structure
- Returns a success/failure status
- Uses performance optimizations to prevent UI lag

### Built Structures Management ⏳
Built structures should:
- Be positioned in a designated area of the scene
- Not overlap with each other
- Be persistent across page reloads
- Be viewable from different angles
- Have a small info panel when clicked (showing name, difficulty, etc.)

### UI Feedback ✅
When a structure is built, the game:
- Shows a congratulatory message with structure name and difficulty
- Displays animated fireworks for visual celebration
- Provides a clear indication that the blocks have been used
- Updates the inventory to reflect the used blocks
- Uses responsive design that works on all screen sizes
