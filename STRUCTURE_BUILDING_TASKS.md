## Implementation Details

### BuildButton Component ✅
The BuildButton component:
- Is positioned prominently in the UI above the inventory
- Shows the name of the structure that can be built
- Has a clear call-to-action ("Build Now!")
- Is styled to match the Minecraft aesthetic with green color and 3D button effect
- Appears only when all required blocks are collected
- Is responsive and works on all screen sizes

### buildStructure Method ✅
The buildStructure method:
- Creates a permanent structure node in the scene (which is then processed by BuiltStructures.tsx)
- Removes the required blocks from the player's inventory (Implemented in completeBuildStructure method)
- Triggers appropriate visual feedback through the StructureBuildFeedback component
- Resets the structure state for the next structure
- Returns a success/failure status
- Uses performance optimizations to prevent UI lag

### Built Structures Management ✅
Built structures should:
- Be positioned in a designated area of the scene (via grid logic in BuiltStructures.tsx) or at a specified debug position.
- Not overlap with each other (when using grid logic).
- Be persistent across page reloads ✅
- Be viewable from different angles
- Have a small info panel when clicked ✅

### UI Feedback ✅
When a structure is built, the game:
- Shows a congratulatory message with structure name and difficulty
- Displays animated fireworks for visual celebration
- Provides a clear indication that the blocks have been used
- Updates the inventory to reflect the used blocks
- Uses responsive design that works on all screen sizes

### NBT File Support ✅
The NBT file support:
- Uses the `prismarine-nbt` library on the server side for proper NBT parsing
- Supports both gzipped and uncompressed NBT files
- Handles different NBT formats (modern structure, classic schematic)
- Provides detailed logging for NBT parsing and structure creation
- Includes proper TypeScript typing for NBT-related interfaces
- Preserves the original Minecraft block data
- Maps Minecraft block IDs/names to our game's block types
- Throws clear errors instead of using fallback structures (as per Issue 8 resolution)
- Includes metadata about the source file in the structure data
- Shows user-friendly messages when no structures are available
