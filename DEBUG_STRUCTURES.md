# Debugging Log: Structure Building & Debug Panel Issues

This document outlines the steps taken to diagnose and address issues related to structure building and debug panel functionality.

## Issue 1: Transparency (Resolved)

- **Symptom:** When clicking the "Build Now!" button after placing a structure using the debug panel, the structure's textures turned transparent.
- **Root Cause:** Unnecessary second execution of `buildStructure` triggered by `BuildButton.tsx` after the debug panel already placed a structure, causing conflicting rebuilds.
- **Fix:**
  - Added `isPermanentlyPlaced` flag to `StructureState` in [`src/game/structureBuilder.ts`](src/game/structureBuilder.ts:1).
  - Updated `BuildButton.tsx` to check this flag and prevent rendering/rebuilding if the structure was already placed.
- **Status:** Resolved.

## Issue 2: Debug Panel Position Ignored (Resolved)

- **Symptom:** Structures spawned via the debug panel always appeared at the default location, ignoring the position set in the debug panel UI.
- **Root Cause:** [`src/components/scene/BuiltStructures.tsx`](src/components/scene/BuiltStructures.tsx:1) ignored the `position` provided in the `structureBuilt` event detail, always using its internal grid logic for placement.
- **Fix:** Modified `handleStructureBuilt` in [`src/components/scene/BuiltStructures.tsx`](src/components/scene/BuiltStructures.tsx:1) to use `event.detail.position` if present, otherwise falling back to grid placement.
- **Status:** Resolved.

## Issue 3: Tiny Structures / Missing Blocks on Debug Spawn (Resolved)

- **Symptom:** After fixing the position issue, structures spawned via the debug panel were tiny and missing some blocks (specifically `planks_spruce` and `log_spruce`).
- **Root Causes:**
  - **Tiny Scale:** The placement animation in `BuiltStructures.tsx` wasn't persisting the final 1.0 scale value.
  - **Missing Blocks:** Incorrect parsing of `blockTypeId` from mesh names in `BuiltStructures.tsx` for IDs containing underscores.
- **Fixes:**
  - **Scale:** Added an `onAnimationEnd` callback to the scale animation in `addPlacementEffects` ([`src/components/scene/BuiltStructures.tsx:258`](src/components/scene/BuiltStructures.tsx:258)) to explicitly set the final scale to `(1, 1, 1)`.
  - **Block Parsing:** Corrected the `blockTypeId` parsing logic in `handleStructureBuilt` ([`src/components/scene/BuiltStructures.tsx:313`](src/components/scene/BuiltStructures.tsx:313)).
- **Status:** Resolved.

## Issue 4: Duplicate Structures on Debug Spawn (Resolved)

- **Symptom:** After fixing the position, scale, and block parsing, spawning from the debug panel resulted in two structures.
- **Root Cause:** The preview visualization from `structureBuilder.updateVisualization()` wasn't being cleared before `structureBuilder.buildStructure()` ran, leaving the preview node orphaned in the scene.
- **Fix:** Reinstated the call to `this.clearVisualization()` at the beginning of `structureBuilder.buildStructure()` ([`src/game/structureBuilder.ts:517`](src/game/structureBuilder.ts:517)).
- **Status:** Resolved.

## Feature Request: Debug Panel Inventory Controls (Implemented)

- **Request:** Add controls to the debug panel to directly add/remove blocks from the player's inventory (`blockAwardManager`) to speed up testing. Improve efficiency of adding blocks needed for structures.
- **Implementation:**
  - Created a new `DebugInventoryControls` component within [`src/components/DebugPanel.tsx`](src/components/DebugPanel.tsx:1).
  - Component lists all `BLOCK_TYPES` with "+" and "-" buttons calling `blockAwardManager.awardBlock()` and `blockAwardManager.removeBlock()`.
  - Added an "Add Blocks" button next to each "Spawn Structure" button in the `StructureTesting` component ([`src/components/DebugPanel.tsx:415`](src/components/DebugPanel.tsx:415)). This button calculates the required blocks for the specific blueprint and calls `blockAwardManager.awardBlock()` accordingly.
  - Integrated `DebugInventoryControls` into the main `DebugPanel` component.
  - Corrected `BlockType` import and fixed minor TS/ESLint errors introduced.
- **Status:** Implemented. Inventory controls (+/- per block) and "Add Blocks" (per structure) are now available in the debug panel. Remaining lint/TS errors are mostly related to `any` types and project configuration (`JSX` namespace) or accessibility warnings, not affecting functionality.

## Current Status (as of 2025-05-07)

- All identified issues related to the debug panel structure spawning (transparency, position, scaling, missing blocks, duplication) have been addressed and resolved.
- Debug panel inventory controls (individual +/- and bulk "Add Blocks") have been added.
- Temporary console logs added during debugging have been removed.

## Next Steps / Remaining Issues

- **Primary Focus:** Test the normal gameplay loop (collect blocks by answering math problems, then click "Build Now!") thoroughly to ensure no transparency, positioning, scaling, or duplication issues occur in this standard path.
- Test the new debug panel inventory controls ("+/-" and "Add Blocks").
- If the normal gameplay loop and inventory controls are successful, the structure building feature and debug tools can be considered stable for these aspects.
- Address remaining ESLint (`any` type usage) and TypeScript (`JSX` namespace) configuration issues for improved code quality and type safety (Lower Priority).
- Address accessibility warnings from Edge Tools for input elements (Lower Priority).
