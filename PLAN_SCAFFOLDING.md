## 2. Core Files & Responsibilities

- **index.html**: Loads Babylon.js, includes main.js, and hosts the canvas and UI overlays.
- **main.js**: Entry point. Initializes Babylon.js engine, loads assets, and starts the game loop.
- **game/gameEngine.js**: Manages game state, main loop, and event flow.
- **game/levelManager.js**: Modular manager for difficulty levels and structure blueprints. Allows easy addition of new levels/structures.
- **game/structureBuilder.js**: Handles logic for collecting blocks and visualizing the Minecraft-style structure.
- **game/mathProblem.js**: Generates and validates math problems per difficulty.
- **game/soundManager.js**: Centralized module for loading, playing, and managing all game sounds.
- **game/rightAnswerHandler.js**: Handles all effects and logic when a player selects the correct answer (e.g., sound, animation, block collection, progress).
- **game/wrongAnswerHandler.js**: Handles all effects and logic when a player selects the wrong answer (e.g., sound, animation, penalties, retry logic).
- **components/CubePlatform.js**: Renders and manages interactive 3D cubes.
- **components/Player.js**: Handles player avatar and movement.
- **components/UI/AvatarSelector.js**: UI for selecting the player avatar.
- **components/UI/MathDisplay.js**: Renders the current math problem and handles answer input.
- **components/UI/StructureView.js**: Visualizes the player's structure as it is built.
- **components/UI/DifficultySelector.js**: UI for selecting difficulty/level.
- **components/UI/StartScreen.js**: Start screen for selecting math type, difficulty, and avatar before starting the game.
- **assets/**: Textures, sounds, and other media.

---

## Design Note: Start Screen Option Wiring

- The StartScreen component collects user selections for math type, difficulty, and avatar.
- On clicking "Start Game," these selections are passed as a single state object to the main game engine (e.g., via a callback or event).
- All game modules (levelManager, mathProblem, Player, etc.) read from this state to configure their behavior and rendering.
- Adding new options (e.g., structure theme) only requires updating StartScreen and the state object; core game logic remains unchanged.
- This ensures modularity, extensibility, and clean separation of UI and game logic.

---

## Design Note: Displaying Math Answers on Cube Platforms

- Each cube platform is a Babylon.js 3D box mesh.
- Math answers are rendered using Babylon.js DynamicTexture, which draws the answer as text onto a 2D canvas and applies it as a texture to the cube face.
- The CubePlatform component receives the answer as a prop/config and encapsulates the rendering logic.
- This approach allows for easy updates to font, color, style, and supports localization and future visual upgrades.
- For advanced visuals, a base block texture can be combined with a dynamic overlay for the answer.
- This method is modular, testable, and fully extensible for new block types or answer formats.

---

## Design Note: Math Answer Generation

- Math problems and answers are generated in a dedicated, testable module (e.g., game/mathProblem.js).
- Each row of cubes displays one correct answer and several plausible distractors, all generated based on the selected math type and difficulty.
- The correct answer and distractors are shuffled and assigned to the cube platforms.
- The generator is data-driven and easily extensible for new math types or difficulty levels.
- All logic is decoupled from rendering/UI, ensuring modularity and testability.
- Unit tests will verify correctness, inclusion of the right answer, and plausibility of distractors.

---

## Design Note: Ensuring Cube Platforms Use Needed Block Types

---

## Recent Avatar/Model System Updates (2025-04-17)

- Avatar selection is now manifest-driven: `/public/models/avatars/manifest.json` lists available avatars.
- Duck avatar variants (Duck0.gltf, Duck1.gltf, Duck2.gltf) are rendered with unique color tints (yellow, red, green) using logic in `AvatarPreview3D.jsx`.
- The avatar system is extensible: add new avatars by updating the manifest and placing the model/texture files in the avatars directory.
- Troubleshooting tip: If a model appears blank, check for missing texture files or incorrect manifest entries.
- The system supports future expansion for more avatars and custom color logic.


- At level start, the structure blueprint is analyzed to determine all block types required and their counts.
- A dynamic tracker maintains how many of each block type are still needed as the structure is built.
- When generating cube platforms, the correct answer is always associated with a block type that is still needed (count > 0).
- Distractor cubes may use other needed types, completed types, or even unused types, depending on desired challenge.
- This ensures every correct answer advances the structure, prevents wasted blocks, and maintains steady player progress.
- All logic is modular and testable, and can be extended for new blueprint or gameplay rules.

---

## Design Note: Dedicated Right/Wrong Answer Handlers

- The game includes two dedicated modules: `rightAnswerHandler.js` and `wrongAnswerHandler.js`.
- `rightAnswerHandler.js` manages all effects and logic for correct answers: playing sounds, triggering animations, awarding blocks, updating progress, and any success feedback.
- `wrongAnswerHandler.js` manages all effects and logic for incorrect answers:
  - Plays a sound and visual feedback (e.g., flashing red).
  - Removes a previously collected block from the structure (if any blocks have been collected).
  - Records the missed math problem in a "missed problems" queue/list.
  - Ensures the missed problem is presented again later in the session (e.g., by reinserting it into the problem queue).
- Both handlers are called by the main game loop or UI event handler when a player selects an answer.
- This separation ensures modularity, makes it easy to update or extend feedback/logic for right or wrong answers, and supports thorough unit testing.

---

## Design Note: Sound Handling

- All sound files are stored in `src/assets/sounds/` with clear, descriptive filenames.
- A centralized, modular `soundManager.js` module handles loading, playing, and managing sounds using Babylon.js's audio system.
- **Audio playback uses Babylon.js's `BABYLON.Sound` class, which wraps the HTML5 Web Audio API (with fallback to <audio> if needed). This supports both 2D and 3D positional sound and is fully cross-platform.**
- Game components trigger sounds via the sound manager (e.g., `playSound('jump')`), never directly.
- The sound manager supports volume control, muting, and user preferences.
- Adding new sounds only requires updating the assets folder and sound manager config.
- All sound logic is testable and decoupled from UI/gameplay logic, ensuring maintainability and extensibility.

---

## 3. Testing Structure
- **tests/unit/**: Jest unit tests for each module/component.
- **tests/integration/**: Playwright integration tests for multi-module flows.
- **tests/e2e/**: Playwright end-to-end tests simulating user behavior.

---

## 4. Modularity & Extensibility
- All levels/structures defined as data/config, not hardcoded in logic.
- Each major feature in its own file; no file >300 lines.
- New levels/structures can be added by extending config and assets only.

### Babylon.js v8+ Sound System Implementation: Findings & Best Practices

**Summary of Correct Approach (as of v8+):**

- Always use Babylon.js's new async API for audio:
  - Use `await BABYLON.CreateAudioEngineAsync()` to create the audio engine.
  - Use `await BABYLON.CreateSoundAsync(name, url, scene)` to load each sound.
  - After loading, call `await audioEngine.unlockAsync()` to ensure playback is allowed (browser gesture requirement).
- Do **not** use `BABYLON.Sound` constructor directly for new sounds.
- Do **not** check `isReady()` on loaded sounds; the async API ensures readiness.
- The returned sound objects may be PromiseSound, not classic BABYLON.Sound.
- To play a sound: just call `.play()` on the sound object after preloading completes.
- All sound loading and engine creation should be awaited before exposing playback to the user.
- If a sound is not playing, check for network errors, file format compatibility, and browser gesture requirements.

**Gotchas:**
- Do not use `.isReady()` or expect classic BABYLON.Sound API on PromiseSound objects.
- Always await the preload process and engine unlock before enabling UI playback.
- Use only valid, browser-compatible audio files (test with .wav and .mp3).
- If you see 'Sound not ready!' or similar errors, revisit async/await flow and engine unlock.

**Best Practice:**
- Centralize all sound loading in `soundManager.js` using the async pattern above.
- Expose soundManager globally for debugging.
- Always update the manifest and preload logic for new sounds.
- Document any new sound additions and verify with a UI button or gesture-triggered event.
